      <description>1.
Indeed I live in the dark ages!
A guileless word is an absurdity. A smooth forehead betokens
A hard heart. He who laughs
Has not yet heard

For it is a kind of silence about injustice!
And he who walks calmly across the street,
Is he not out of reach of his friends</description>
